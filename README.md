## Product Vision Statement
Huddle is a web app solution to the problem of wanting to play a game of your favorite sport but missing the required amount of players. Huddle connects you to your local talent and allows you to organize immediate pick-up games. Huddle also saves your win-loss history and allows other people to rank your skills after playing a match.

## Short History
The idea of Huddle came from asking friends and family which issues they have that they believe could be solved by technology. My brother, an advid baseball player, told me he always hates when he does not have enough players to start a game of baseball at the park. He said he wished there could be an app that connects players to each other for pickup games. I built on this idea to include rankings to gamify experiences and make sports more enjoyable to progess in skill.
